High Altitude Balloon Project. Code that NOEXC develops for use on their near
space adventures.

These flights are documented on the
[NOEXC wiki](https://noexc.org/wiki/NOEXC_Balloon_Project).

This code is under pretty constant development and is targeted at the
requirements of our next flight, whatever that happens to be. We will tag code
as what we used on a given flight.

We hope you find this helpful.
